There were lemon slices under my bed and next to the TV. They eventually got someone to uclog the shower but the experience was not good.

77,77,77,716 21st St,Hotels,Virginia Beach,Ambassadors Inn and Suites,23451,VA,1.0,I have to say this was the worse experience I have ever had at a hotel. Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.,melissa

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",A Traveler

The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture.

223,223,226,480 King St,"Hotels,Hotel",Alexandria,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",22314,VA,5.0,A wonderful 2 night stay in Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Room was decorated beautifully. Bathroom was luxurious with all the amenties. Bed was wonderful and comfortable. Hotel was right in the heart of Old Town with no reason to move/use the car. Staff was always great. I particularly liked that the staff at the door ALWAYS welcomed me back or wished me a nice day. And that staff in other locations always made eye contact/smiled/had a positive comment.Only tiny negative was finding a previous patron's leftovers in the mini fridge.,A verified traveler
224,224,227,480 King St,"Hotels,Hotel",Alexandria,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",22314,VA,3.0,"I booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the ""notes"" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.",A verified traveler

There is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. Once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. You end up in some garage down the street.

Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??].

Some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. The fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. Kinda odd. It's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks!

DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station.

Many other Alexandria hotels are by far superior!  This property is a former Holiday Inn and it still unfortunately felt like it.  I will stay at other hotels when I get back to Alexandria and will not consider this one.  This is so far below the standards of the DuPont Circle Palomar that I was shocked.  Unfortunately This will probably lead me to not consider other Kimpton hotels I have not seen before I stay at them.  The hotel was way way overpriced for what it is.  The chain needs to fix this one because it brings down the entire Kimpton reputation. They have a great King Street location but that is all.  The hotel did not even offer free newspapers--inexcusable for the price.  I left after one night and  spent the next four nights in a nearby hotel that was everything this one was not--and I paid $100 a night less.  This is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel.,Kristyn

If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items.

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective.

Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators.

I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog!

Absolutely horrible. The front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! The room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. I understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. Do not stay here!

Front desk had no record of the first call. By now the room temp was 82 degrees. The front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. We left for the day and returned 7 pm. The a/c was STILL not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. Our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. We asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.Second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at Arlington Cemetery. The night before, my son needed his shoes shined. We called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. Next morning: shoes had not been touched. When I complained to the front desk, I was told: ""Why didn't you bring them down to the desk?

This time, I chose the Hotel Monaco to stay at and I was very impressed. The hotel was very nice and clean and perfectly situated. I think the only negative I could find is that the valet's weren't very attentive. When I first pulled up to check in before rushing off to a meeting, I couldn't even get the valet's attention to see if I could leave my car there for a minute although I pulled up right next to him as he was having a conversation with a co-worker and I ended up parking on the street around the corner. Other times, the valets also seemed to be too preoccupied to pay attention to their valet lane and for people waiting around to have someone retrieve their cars.",A verified traveler

The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).

I'm a gold member w Expedia and I always get shafted when I book with them. This is the third time in a row I've had to complain to Expedia about their ""partner"" hotels.",A verified traveler

The desk clerks were short and not forthcoming with information about the area. When you are in town for only 24 hours, my time in town is precious and I would expect them to volunteer helpful information for a tourist.

Overall, it's a good hotel at a good price. However, there are some logistics problems - the entrance to the hotel is in the back of a small shopping mall area, so you have to go through the mall and take an elevator up to the hotel lobby. There is no real drop off location for taxis, and if someone is picking you up you need to make sure you clarify which of the three mall entrances they will come to ... or walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door. That said, the room was clean and spacious, the hotel restaurant was quite pleasant, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",David

Wow - large dining table, modern living room furnishings, sliding split door into bedroom is what I expect from larger and more expensive hotels. All the modern amenities you would expect of a 5-star hotel are at this hotel. The 4th floor offers courtesy water and coffee every morning. Room service is also excellent, and prices are quite reasonable in light of the current money exchange rates between pesos and dollars. Housekeeping is quick with delivery for more towels, and hair dryer as requested in our last trip to this hotel. Hotel is located 2 floors above the Parque Alameda Shopping mall with several quick service restaurants you would expect in the U.S., a bank, bookstore, coffee shop, sporting goods store.

The meal was very over priced and unfortunately the most expensive but worst meal of our holiday. My husband ordered lobster which hadn't been cleaned properly and I was disappointed with my order. There were plenty of other places to eat in town which was only a 10 minute walk and we found the food much better in the restaurants there. The nearest beach was clean, quiet (at the end of July) and beautiful although if you hire a car there are plenty of other similar beaches within a reasonable distance. Recommend car hire to see more of the island but although the roads are in good condition be prepared for sharp corners on fast mountainous roads with sheer drops.

We asked the staff on three occasions to fix it (and showed them on our device that we don't make it up because they claimed it worked). When we left they claimed that an IT guy fixed it but they never asked us before whether it worked for us. The least we would expect in a FIVE star hotel. - we had to pay about 100 USD for roaming fees instead (as we had to work). We were not offered a discount or anything. - Breakfast EUR 30 per person, some cutlery not clean - Shower head broken (but fixed on the next they when we told it to the staff) - Gym oldish, one thread mill not working. Spider webs in corners - Hotel is located above a busy street (separating hotel from beach). In our room with sea view, we couldn't leave the windows open and balcony was just for decoration but not really for use The above critics sounds harsh, but we expected definitely more of an expensive five star hotel.",Paul

They ran out of several items at the overpriced breakfast (EUR 30/person) before closing. Housekeeping was ok, but several small mistakes that you wouldn't expect from a 5* hotel. Reception staff was friendly. Nice, but small pool. Charged EUR 10 for a beach towel plus umbrella. Fantastic beaches within 30 mins drive. Beautiful views from the terrace. Dinner was average, but expensive relative to what you could get anywhere else.

I chose this location because it had 3 rooms available for our 9 travelers and its proximity to I-90. Had I not been tied to the reservation, I would have walked out during check-in. I always book through Hotels.com and have never had trouble. In this case, I was questioned repeatedly about our numbers and given numbers that did not include the children. When, in hopes to make sure I did not err in booking, I told the man at the counter the number including the kids, he said that our reservations would be more expensive. I protested and explained that we had 5 children in the group, he continued to grill me on our numbers. The whole process took 25 minutes. Not only was the barrage of questions belittling and rude, the man continued to tell me that his boss would take his job if he saw all of us the next morning. Surprise! The next morning, the boss was not in and the same person that checked us in was at the desk. I told him that I wanted to speak to the owner (about the check-in and the fact that 2 air conditioners were not working), he told me I couldn't. I told him I was very disappointed and he told me fine, just leave. I have stayed at Super 8's before and had no trouble. This experience has made me so angry that I have contacted the chain to let them know that this particular location was not representing its name well. I will never stay at the Worthington Super 8 again.",Erin

I actually ended with this hotel based on the fact that they didn't just have a waffle maker and juice. The room was in need of some improvements... shower head and bath tub looked kind of old, air conditioner even when run all night would not get the room below about 75 degrees, 15 year old television, and pillows had been through the wash so many times they were giant fluff balls.

We explained the situation and he brought us water. Luckily our friends returned shortly after and were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room. We went back to check in three hours later and were told we didn't have a room in the same building. Forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right and our going to put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site. When we checked in later, we were told that we could move for a thousand for 4 nights. Needless to say they didn't make it right. I heard several people at the pool say they had similar situations with check in. Seemed to be scam. Be prepared to have every meal at the Bistro interrupted by a woman trying to sell spa packages.

Food was ok for the most part, first night buffet area was being remodeled so the available area was small and food choices minimal. Theme nights were good however seafood night lacked seafood. Other than fish you had to search for other seafood in rice, pasta or stew. Final downgrade was based on misinformation, after attending the two hour sales session we were given resort credit, some things were listed as not included golf, prepaid services, and boutique. We decided to use our credit to spread the wealth to the staff in gratuities. Upon check out we were then told gratuities were not included and we were now responsible for the amount accrued.

That being said, from day one they try to get you to buy a timeshare. It became annoying. You spend quite a bit of your day riding shuttles and golf carts around the property and between properties. The good thing about that is that the property is large and the sister properties are on swimable beaches.

We waited an hour for our food one night. Since the grounds are built on a hill, getting around is not easy and requires cart service to get around. Sometimes the wait was longer than expected for a cart to come by. We would have walked but the paths were not built for pedestrian use and could be dangerous. Food is very expensive, glad we opted for the all inclusive option. The high end restaurant LaFrida was well worth the extra 30 per person. If you don't mind wasting 3 hours, go on the time share presentation to get resort credit. We got 400 dollars which we used on two massages and the high end restaurant. Just keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long... which it wasn't. Don't feel bad about saying no to those salespeople. They are slimy like used car salesmen. Pay close attention to the bill when you check out, we had an issue with a very large extra charge that we found. It is unfortunate that they did not catch it first, and I didn't have to warn you. Do not do any of the buffets at La Nao, almost all the food is room temperature. There is food and drink service at the pools, but all the waiters moved at a much slower pace, and preferred to talk with each other than serve guests. Now besides the items I mentioned, it really was a nice place overall, and worth the money we paid. Probably will not return but onl",Ray & Stacia

I finally sat through the presentation to get the hotel credits and it took 2-1/2 hours (they said it would take 90 minutes). They started off with a soft-sell which I declined. Then the manager comes over with a harder sell (I said no again), then they transferred me to a gentleman who was to finalize the credits and he was so aggressive that I had to tell him very firmly that I was NOT interested and that he was making me feel uncomfortable. Then HIS manager came over and he was so rude. I was really upset after that. So, while I loved the property, I will NEVER go back because of that.",Margaret

Almost 50 different buildings located on different steps of a mountain. Food was god, lots of different options. This is a big big resort and yes size does matter. When I first heard this resort is huge and some people were complaining about it. I was wondering how being so big can be a bad thing. Well, its not bad but it is not so good either for a family. If I were in my 20's, I would have absolutely love this huge resort. You can either jump on a golf cart or just jump, run and walk from one building to other. It would give me an opportunity to digest all the all inclusive foods also. But when you have a four month old infant with you, this might not be that good. Carrying the infant in your lap and making sure neither your infant nor his stroller falls of the cart when golf carts are moving fast through the hill could be a challenge. There is no way you can park your car next to your building. You have to self park or valet park close to lobby area and than take a golf cart to go to your room. Now if you are either on third floor or first floor you have to take the stairs to go to your room. None of this matter if your are young or energetic, it is rather fun.

Expedia lists gratuities as included in the package, however we received an itemized bill after every meal which included a tip line. It became clear that servers expected tips from the all-inclusive customers as well. When we asked the front desk and time-share sales staff, we received different answers. The most common being that gratuities are included, but if you receive exceptional service you should feel free to tip your waiter above and beyond the included portion. We were finally told that 5 of our all-inclusive fee was split amongst all the staff, and the waiters only earn 75 pesos a day in wages. Therefore, they count on tips as part of their wages, and apparently the 5 doesn't really do the trick. Not wanting to rip off the staff, I gave additional tips. If I had started my vacation expecting to tip, I would have enjoyed my first few days much more than I did. The disconnect between my expectations and reality were a cause of tension, not only for me, but for other customers that I spoke to as well. 2. When we arrived they didn't have our junior suite ready, so they put us in another room which didn't have a safe, had a leak and puddle in the hallway outside the room, didn't have a working microwave, and took 5 minutes for the hot water in the shower to heat up. 3.

As soon as you land to hotel, everyone comes to you with their pitches to join a breakfast tour(Timeshare meeting).. 4.

We always mentioned it as a possible vacation as we all wanted to go back. We planned the trip and confirmed three rooms as our kids had friends coming with them. When we arrived our room wasnt ready (we were early). But they were having trouble finding three rooms let alone 3 rooms close together. The front desk manager came out and asked us to go into one of the villas at montechristo. This was an upgrade but we were hesitant because we had no idea about the room set up and the distance. The manager assured us we would be just as close as the building we were in before. We were also promised 200 off resort charges. The villa was beautiful but we were as far away as could be. We had to call for a shuttle which frequently took 10-15 minutes just to get to the edge of the resort then walk or ride a golf cart to the pools and restaurants. We had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our villa. When I went in to complain, I was told that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts. Room service was never less than an hour because they had the same issues in getting to us. The distance was a big problem and I feel the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem. At checkout, no one could find where the manager had given us the resort credit(it was written on a voucher we presented)",S

It is high pressure marketing to buy into their properties from the moment you arrive until departure time. Even after we saw the presentation, before calling up a cab for us to go to town, the staff would ask us if we'd seen the presentation and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property. The is a complete lack of consistency throughout the hotel, the food would come out differently each time. For example one night we ate at the Japanese restaurant and really enjoyed it so we returned only to be very disappointed. We had to ask several times for ginger and wasabi and never received it, our order was completely wrong and the food was not nearly as good. That night we asked for bottled water (we had the all inclusive plan) and the bartender would only give us one each - that only happened at one of the pool bars near our room. The hotel is inconveniently located quite far from town and although the beach is beautiful there it is not swimmable. The staff did not seem well traveled and many of them could come across as indifferent or rude at times. Beautiful on the surface but lacking in quality of product.",M

My family enjoyed this resort because the amenities were on point, amazing food drinks etc, but I love the water, so if I could I would have been in the ocean the entire time. Just depends on what you like. And since the resort is basically on the side of the mountain, you have to take golf carts everywhere, which were no big deal. But again, it depends on what you like.

The all inclusive is definitely worth it. Like people mentioned, there are some time share people that will chat you up a bit but since we are both under 30, they left us alone very quickly. I'm sure they assume you have to be that age to even be considered a prospect. Also, you can't swim in the ocean but it's really not a big deal. We took some nice walks on the beach and hung out at the pools all day. Bartenders there took great care of us! and it was very easy to catch golf carts and rides around the property. Would definitely go back :)",A

1789,1789,1810,Predio Paraiso Escondido S/n,Hotels,Virginia Beach,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,23450,VA,4.0,Attentive staff. Good food plenty to drink. There are some negatives. The staff was constantly pressuring us to go to the presentation to buy into the the development. I found myself trying to hid from them. The beach is unusable due to the staff keeping us from the beach surf because some people drowned. They didn't tell me in advance of these things. I believe I'll stay somewhere else next time.,I
1790,1790,1811,Predio Paraiso Escondido S/n,Hotels,Virginia Beach,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,23450,VA,3.0,The trip was good overall but the complex is so big that taking a cart around was the only way to get anywhere. The carts should come around every 5 minutes but it was more like 20-30 minutes. When you first arrive they have a company that sells you cheaper excursions at a discount if you go to the property time share and what they don't tell you is you will still need to pay more fee's when you get to the excursion. Don't try to get a refund becuase they will pass you around from supervisiors to Managers.,I
1791,1791,1812,Predio Paraiso Escondido S/n,Hotels,Virginia Beach,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,23450,VA,3.0,Front desk staff provided false information. During check-in it was promised they will arrange wifi for all four guests. But it never worked. Only two can connect simultaneously and when went to support they just mentioned the front desk staff provided incorrect information. Service is very slow and delayed every time.

The food was good. 99 of the staff were friendly and helpful. The services at the spa were dreamy. The front desk staff were lackluster in customer service at check in and check out. The room we booked was unavailable and they initially downgraded us (family of 4 with 3 people 6 feet tall and over) and added roll away beds. But after a stern discussion the next day we got much better accommodations. Timeshare sales people were pushy for the first 3 days but then backed off. Pools were nice. View was amazing. Waking and falling asleep to the lapping of the ocean - priceless.,H

My main disappointment is that 'all inclusive' doesn't apply to all resteraunts (upcharge for the three nicest eateries) and activities (tennis, as an example). I don't believe the Expedia description accurately reflected this or it was in the small print that I didn't read. Also, you must be prepared for the wind on the Pacific side of Cabo. It's very windy this time of year.",Steve
1796,1796,1817,Predio Paraiso Escondido S/n,Hotels,Virginia Beach,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,23450,VA,2.0,"CONS: The front desk was business with a smirk not a smile. This resort is built alongside the non-swimmable beach of Cabo. The views are magnificent but the currents are so strong that you absolutely positively can not get close. YOU WILL DIE NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A SWIMMER YOU ARE! Four people died in it last month alone! This resort is also build on a huge property alongside a mountain/hill. You will be totally exhausted if you want to walk to any of it's main locations. Fortunately they have drivers driving golf carts to take you everywhere on the property and they are very accessible. The problem is that they also pollute the air with the gasoline smell, which is not very pleasant. Their driveway from start to the lobby is about a 5-7 minute drive. What makes it unpleasant is the entire road is made of beautifully laid pavers which make for a very bump ride. Because this resort is away from the main action (swimmable side of the beach, which I found is still not very swimmable), they have a free shuttle, which was always full, to take you to and from their sister hotel called Rose. I had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the beach. Ana at Rose didn't give a **** that the shuttles couldn't accommodate extra people needing a ride to/from the resort. She refused to be of any assistance saying I was the other hotel's problem. The solution was to book in advance which was still always booked. Anyway, the food was mediocre and very expensive for what you got.",Steve

It was at 98 occupancy and because the property was so large, you hardly ever see anyone. The AC was on point everywhere you go, the hotel was extremely clean, my room was awesome.

Even with the all-inclusive plan, they still require us to sign a bill at each dinning, including snacks, this is really a nuisance, and there is nothing stock in the refrigerator (no water or soda).

The location was great, right across the street from the Mall. The downside is that you are also close to the airport and we could hear the planes from our room, but that really didn't bother us too much. The room was nice and what we expected. Kitchenette was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old. The separate bedroom was also nice. We did have breakfast that the hotel offered. Waffles, cereal, fruit, toast/bagels, juice, and some other hot items were offered. This was okay. There were cheese omelettes and you could tell they used egg beaters, so I didn't care for those, but otherwise it was fine for breakfast included with your rate. The one negative thing I will say is that Saturday when we checked out, I went down to the front desk around 10am-a very busy time, and the front desk only had one person working. This was terrible. The line was long and people were not happy. For being a weekend, there should have been 2 people working here. One other thing to touch on that didn't bother me so much, but it might some others. When I asked for a receipt, they only email you a receipt, nothing printed. Those who don't use the internet would not like this.

My credit card is currently disputing the charge after confirming that it was a second charge. I will get the charge removed. What bothers me is not so much the mistake, but that this seems highly unethical. I keep close track of my spending in an excel spreadsheet, but if I didn't, which most people probably don't, I probably would have assumed it never got charged and let it go.

Carpet throughout the hotel in public areas looked liked it hadn't been vacuummed for several days, poor design. We couldn't imagine eating breakfast at this hotel due to its uncleanliness.

Night desk clerk happily changed it to the room next door, which wasn't as musty. Decor is old and carpeting, curtains, and bed-spread should be updated to give a cleaner look/feel. The in-room safe was locked so you can't use it(that's why they didn't charge the 5/night fee). There's also some meeting/convention rooms that are used by church and tour groups. Fortunately groups eat in a separate breakfast area. Breakfast was very basic. Inside is a car rental shop. The business center is in the hallway. Front desk provided cookies at night and coffee/water in the hallway. The non-front doors weren't secured by room key access alone, rather they were open to anyone who wanted to wander in. The room door was not neatly lined up with the door jamb, but the lock worked. There were also a lot of student groups staying to visit DC- they were loud and noisy at night but eventually went to sleep. There is ample parking. They share a shuttle van to Springfield Franconia Metro station with the Wyndham next door, which may have been a bit nicer hotel. I probably won't stay there again.

1955,1955,1978,6560 Loisdale Ct,Hotels,Springfield,Comfort Inn - Springfield,22150,VA,3.0,"It's a fairly basic place to stay. My family stayed for a week, choosing this hotel because of price and the good reviews. The price was one of the lowest in the entire metro area. But, price does not equal value. The outdoor pool and shuttle service are shared with the hotel next door, which isn't made clear in the listing. More than once, the shuttle stopped and waited for people to get on next door and proceeded to either drive off immediately without stopping or was too full to carry the passengers waiting here. When you're in DC, expect to wait -- that's just how things work here. (TIP for the hotel: Arlington Cemetery's gravesite shuttle has a direct phone, instead of a two-way radio.) Our housekeeper was good, but there was a roach in our room. Nice bedding and towels. The bed was uncomfortable, but there were signs posted that said that the hotel was beginning a remodel. The hot breakfast was meh, and the breakfast area was very small for the size of the hotel. Most of the staff at this hotel speaks a language other than English as a first language -- can be problematic if you are calling for the shuttle and can't understand what they are saying. This hotel is definitely not in the easy-off, easy-on category. The hotel is located in an extra-confusing maze of roads. Getting to the hotel from the interstate isn't too bad, but getting back to the interstate and finding restaurants nearby is rather difficult. We'll find somewhere else next time.",S

I arrived to find out that the reservation had been cancelled as I was listed as a No Show.

In addition to the overall residual smell of smoke in the room, the bathroom was extremelly smelly. It was interesting to note that all the rooms but ours had a room number with a non-smoking or smoking symbol on it (hmmmm...) Room 115 was also at the beginning of the 'smoking' rooms along the hallway, and if I remember correct, the room across the hall was a smoking room.

I went down to ask for clean sheets and the clerk after some hesitation said she would bring me new ones. I waited an hours and 15 minutes and nobody came. When I went back to the counter, there were now two clerks and there seemed to be a lot of confusion. While I was there, a lady came to the front counter and actually brought a bed bug that she found in her room. I asked for a refund and left.

This room had all the basic appliances to make your stay comfortable including a mini fridge. Overall this hotel was above average for its price range but the beds in our room were creaky and old. Given this room price was at the top of the range for its hotel bracket, I expected a more comfortable bed. I've stayed at lower range places and slept better since the beds were better.

No way I'm using ice from some funky looking ice trays that I don't know how clean they are or who has touched them. Vending machines were practically empty. Hotel entrance doors were hard to open and no power door opener for handicap or if you had your arms full. It would be pretty much impossible for someone in a wheelchair to come in or go out unassisted. Surprised that doesn't violate some code. Free wifi was a joke since it was about the speed of dial-up.

She was irritated that I wanted plates at a late hour and couldn't believe we wouldn't eat from our to-go boxes. Other little thing was the breakfast, if you can call it that. No milk, no juice. There was coffee, tea, individually wrapped muffins, oatmeal packs, and then oranges and apples. That was it. Big problem was a barking dog. For many hours our neighbor had a dog that did nothing but yelp and bark. Witch at the front desk didn't care or offer to do anything about it. She said they accepted dogs and next time I should ask to be put away from pets (like I knew this ahead of time).

The room wasn't spectacular, but could have used a little more TLC. They could have included towels so we could use the shampoo, conditioner and soap that were provided.

I thought it was a joke but not. There were very few guests at all so not sure why the short memory. I questioned whether this was a true concern about my stay or just something they are made to say. I booked via Expedia and it shows a lovely pool/hot tub - one of the only reasons why I booked out of my way for this location only to find out after booking both are under renovation until next year. Boo! My room had items left from someone else and had a funky odor. The windows were opened and unlocked which I didnt find until after I came back from being in town. Guests are allowed to smoke outside of the hotel and there is a bench to do so. My non-smoking room was located above the bench facing the front parking lot on the third floor and I smelled cigarette smoke my entire stay because of the smokers hanging around the bench. Lastly, there are MAJOR road construction projects around this location (getting to/from hotel) whichcaused delays getting to where I needed to be.

An area map would be useful when gps cannot figure out the area. I felt I frustrated them when I asked for street names rather than turn left here or there.

Certainly they will leave scars. I spoke with the staff about the issue on the weekend, three of which disclosed that there was a bed bug issue that should have been addressed. I was told that Chad, the front desk manager, would be available the following morning and that he would be able to assist. Chad was there, as promised. He was very accommodating but unfortunately, could only do what's best for his company, not for me, the customer. I received a call back from him, after several unsuccessful attempts to reach him and after calling the health department and the regional office. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!

It's reliable, affordable and generally I have always been happy when I have stayed here. The free hot breakfast is a nice touch and staff is generally accommodating and helpful. This time however, it seems that the air conditioning was not working in my room, something I wasn't aware of until I finally retired for the evening. Despite setting the thermostat to 60 and the function to cool, it was hot, humid and made it very difficult to sleep comfortably. It was late at night when I turned in, so I bit the bullet because I didn't feel like packing up and moving to another room in the middle of the night. Maybe this was just a malfunction of the A/C in my room and the rest of the rooms are fine, but I would check when you arrive to ensure that you didn't have the same experience that I did.

The basement looks scary and filthy if I had the opportunity to see the basement first i know i would never have stayed at this hotel. This is first time I ever felt unsafe at a hotel. The parking deck area needs better lighting to dark. My room was on the 4th floor the hallway smells maybe the carpet needs shampooing or just needs new carpet. The room was clean but bed was very lumpy new mattress needed ...shower pressure was horrible at anytime of the day really horrible ...the free breakfast i woulnt dare eat it do to the lack of upkeep of the facility hotel was...I can't comment on the staff I only saw the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time.....Otherwise, if the above things dont really bother you then the hotel does offer you a quiet room ....great location (it may not look like it from your hotel window but you're really close to a lot of things) ...good rates...sorry I didn't mean to write a book just wanted to give an honest opinion of my experience. ...",VCU Visiting Parent

We stood there stunned and then she asked (dismissively), Is there anything else I said, No, I'll just try to figure out where my son will sleep tonight. She met us on our way back to our room and lectured us again about using a 3rd party booking service. At that point I pointed out that hotels.com is the only reason we found this hotel other hotels weve booked didnt have this issue. 10 minutes later she showed up at our door with a bed.

I ate both in the restaurant and ordered room service, and the food was fine, though nothing to write home about.The best part about the Hyatt Centric, aside from its location, was the staff. Everyone I encountered, from the front desk staff, to the bellhop, to the servers in the restaurant, to the room service waiters, to the cleaning staff was SO friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond to be sure my stay was excellent.",A verified traveler

Don't forget the Green Mill restaurant next door. You can have room service, which I liked. We ate there three times.

The rooms all have DVD players and they have movies there you can borrow. They also provided us with fluffy white terrycloth robes and aromatherapy beads for the jacuzzi. The gas fireplace was also very nice. It was too cold to swim (May 3-6) but the pool looked great and I was sad I didn't get to try it out. Our stay was delightful and I recommend it highly for singles or couples who just need a break from it all!",knockknock964

We just returned from a one night stay at the Bailey House in the Bailey Room. It was a very nice BB and enjoyed our stay. Here are some specifics: General: * Innkeepers, Karen and John, were very nice. They provide some dinner recommendations which were greatly appreciated. This was a great perk! And, one reason we would stay at a BB over a hotel. * In-ground pool was very clean. Water temperature was 78 degrees when we checked at 10am. * Gardens around pool were very pretty. * Breakfast was so so delicious! Bailey Room: * Very pretty and clean * Whirlpool tub is HUGE! And, the robes/candles were a nice touch! * TV 19 - Fine for us because we were not there to watch TV. * We could hear the people walking above us. This did not bother us. * Bed sheets were luxurious! * Bed was very very firm/flat. We would have appreciated a more luxurious bed. * Bathroom and towels were basic. I would have appreciated fluffier towels. My husband did not notice. * The only way to play music in our room was through the DVD player/TV. It would have been nice to have a good CD player. * No treats, like chocolate, in our room :( This is my second BB experience. My first experience was at a higher priced BB and offered a bit more luxury - but breakfast was definitely not delicious like Karen's at The Bailey House. Overall, I would stay at The Bailey House again because of the wonderful breakfast, whirlpool tub and pretty pool area. But, it would be great if they made a few tweaks to bump up the experience to a excellent rating.",springsautoclinic

The inkeepers made this BB so special for everyone! They paid attention to all of the little details and the inn itself was top notch! They brought us lemonade when we were swimming in the heated pool and loungin on the hammoc in the HUGE back yard area. The breakfasts were some of the best I've ever had in my LIFE! Karen is like your own personal Martha Stuart. John, her husband, kept us entertained every morning with fabulous tales, and stories of their life and the town. The JUMBO hot tub in the Baily room was so big we could almost swim in it, and the private door to the screen porch and pool was perfect access to the homey and beautifully gardened pool/patio area. After 4 nights here we didn't want to go home. We've stayed in MANY BBs across the country and for 160- 180 a night this was by far the best! There was nothing I'd like to change and nothing either of us could find fault with. It was specail and you really feel like part of the family - like your grandparents are taking care of you while you're visiting their house.

Located on Main Street, it is within walking distance of the city's major attractions. The hotel is located in a very cool looking historical building. In the late 80's/early 90's, the building was the home of an indoor mall/department store. Since that time, the interior has been gutted and very large rooms put in. I'm not 100 sure, but I'm guessing that the original intent was to create apartment rentals. The hallways are very wide and the rooms are very large. Our room was loft style with the sleeping area in the loft area. On the lower level was a full kitchen and a living/dining area. There were 2 TV's in the room --- one on the lower level and one on the second level. The room was clean and very spacious. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate. There was a small fitness room on the 5th floor of the hotel. The lobby was large, contemporary looking, and accessible from both the front and back of the hotel. A large parking lot for the hotel was located in the back at a cost (to hotel guests) of 17/night. Overall, this was a great place to stay and the price was right. I highly recommend this location.",Zell

The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean.

It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel.

The bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  However, after the visitation for my grandmother's funeral my cousins, aunts, uncle and I met up in the restaurant, and that's where the nightmare occurred.1.  I ordered gluten free because I have celiac, and the waitress put the order in for regular.  Fortunately, I figured it out before eating it.  When I received my gluten free burger I was completely underwhelmed.  Plus, I ordered it with bacon and didn't receive it.2.  Another order at our table was lost completely so it took over an hour for them to get their food.  When they complained to the manager he got hostile and did not make any amends.3.  It took over 1/2 hour for everyone to get their food even though we all ordered separately and at different times.4.  When food came the waitress gave the wrong orders to people.  She was very nice, but I wonder if she was new.5.  After that I saw the manager having a hissy fit at the front desk.

This was all going on with exit doors ajar and workers coming in and out of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather.

We were in 133, which was directly affected by construction involving loud drills, pulled up carpet, exposed concrete and falling and broken plaster all over our hallways. Sounds, smells and the general aura was that of a construction zone, not a 4 star hotel. We traveled from CA with our 18 month old baby for my father's funeral. At a time when we needed comfort, peace and quiet, and a little aesthetic amenity, we got loud voices, early morning drilling, entire hallways of cold open concrete with old and large cracks and broken plaster on the floor, among other debris, all in the already uncomfortable arctic tundra cold of the dead of winter in fond du Lac. My husband fell over broken plaster congealed onto the concrete hallway and broken plastic ties strewn up and down the hazardous hallway. Our baby was awoken by drilling after finally falling asleep while being sick, and I got to write my dad's eulogy to the tune of construction and hammering and loud talking right outside my door. Bottom line, if you are going to have major renovation right outside of rooms that you are booking, disclose it and be prepared to offer an accommodation better than one night at half off.",Melissa

We tried the breakfast buffet that was free, but opted to go across the street to another place. And the strangest thing was that there were servers during the buffet (that was free) that did nothing but take away plates and bring us a bill. I asked what the bill was for since it was free and they said it was for their tip. Now, I normally tip very well, but we got our own food, our own drinks, and they only thing the server brought Mr was a bill asking for a tip. What?",Brandon

It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.

Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.

The hotel has a wonderful view of the beach and you can see the fireworks from the balcony. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but the room was overall clean. The beds were definitely comfortable. The door that separates the two rooms were unlocked unfortunately. The people in the other room opened our door and of course we were not expecting someone walking through that door since it is normally locked. I did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got to the room. I just assumed it was always locked. Lesson learned for sure.,Jennifer

The lady I talked with at the front desk had no personality at all. I told her I had reservations with a early check in time and when she first open her mouth I knew this was not going to go well. She told me it would be around 2PM before I could get a room so I ask her would she put me on the top of the list for the first room because i had been traveling all day. the no personality come out again in her and I know we would not get a room early. when I stepped out to the car I told my wife we could forget a early check in and I was right. We set in the lobby in plain view of the front desk watching guest being checked in. Finally after sitting there from 11AM to 1:45PM I stepped back up to the desk and ask why I'm sitting here for about three hours watching people being checked in. she told me it was the type room i was getting. There was another lady there this time listening to what i was saying that i had been sitting here for about three hours. I left and went set back down at 1:55PM. 1:58PM they called me back up there and gave me the keys. She was making me wait to show me she was in control and she cared less about the guest.

When I was finally greeted I began the check-in process with the manager I presume and then I was passed off to another employee when another customer walked in. I shrugged it off as I thought maybe they were just busy (there were only 3 people). The next day I went to pick up a drink and a snack from the concierge and again I stood there at the counter without even a hello while the employee looked at the computer and then paperwork. When I was finally greeted, I started my transaction with the employee and again was passed off to another employee, presumably another manager. What should have taken 1 minute took 5 and I was really starting to feel like my business was not appreciated here. The room was decent, but it had an old smell similar to mildew in the bathroom that really bothered me. I almost checked out of the hotel the first night to go across the street to another.

Was very close to Smithsonian Air space museum , Chantilly Va. near Dullas airport. Grand kids loved the pool, but because it was indoors the room was a little noisy very difficult to sit and read.

The ceremony was to be outside in the harbor but a late bout of rain shortly before the ceremony time made it be changed to be inside. The communication, and speed of the work that was done to transition to set up for the ceremony to the inside in what seemed like no time and with no attitude shown to us. I believe it was set up in the ballroom upstairs and was very nice with an overview of the harbor. We used the Porto for the cocktail hour(inside because of rain) and also for the reception, it may not seem like a big space but it can be used wisely and use imagination and the Porto can be decorated to look even better than it is. There was also a guy that looked to be directly assisting Tabitha, whom I didn't get a name but was also extremely helpful and made sure we were happy with the event throughout different parts of the day/night. Definitely would recommend the Abbey for a wedding! The food for the reception was all just as good as what we had at the tasting and were not mislead.

We thoroughly enjoy the beautiful and relaxing decor of the resort, the gorgeous and outstanding lush grounds and the choice of amenities (The Avani Spa, The Waterfront, 240 West, The Arcade, etc.). We were able to have our entire wedding week held at The Abbey Resort. It was so convenient for our guests to attend all events at one location- from the rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. The Harbor Gazebo, our ceremony site, was beautifully maintained. The white chairs provided were classy and appropriate. The Harbor Ball Room was beautiful! We were thrilled with the timeliness of table setup prior to our event. We were happy with quality of linens, napkins, and table placings. The layout of the room, specialty tables and bars was functional and easy to navigate. The food was exceptional, just as we remembered from our menu tasting. The quality and choice of beverages were great. We were excited to be able to offer our family and friends favorite drink options throughout the evening. Tabitha Bell, our event planner and manager was exceptional! Her energy, charisma and bubbly personality made every interaction a pleasure! Tabitha was professional, on the ball and offered her expert opinion that aided in creating the wedding of our dreams. She provided AMAZING recommendation for outside wedding vendors and definitely did NOT steal us wrong! Lisa Colbert, the Avani Spa Wedding Coordinator, was wonderful to work with. She and the stylists, make up artists and nail technicians provided quality work, spending extra time on each of the members of our wedding party, making sure no one felt rushed!Claire Roddy, our hotel booking manager, was a pleasure to work with.

A ton of credit goes to our wedding coordinator ��� Tabby Bell. The entire process from the introduction meetings till the wedding went smoothly.

Tabby offered a lot of suggestions and was very much engaged which helped put us at ease and took a good amount of stress off of us. The Abbey Resort is an incredible venue and we would do the same thing over again. My wife always wanted to have a tent wedding that incorporated the ���lake��� feel, so when we found The Abbey we got pretty excited. Our guests keep talking about how awesome the entire weekend was. The great thing about The Abbey is that there is so much to do to keep guests entertained. Pools, Bars in walking distance, Spa, Restaurants��� The accommodations / hotel rooms were well maintained and very clean as well. For our wedding weekend there was an awesome band at the Waterfront bar (located within The Abbey) that played both nights. We closed it down both nights as well!The food at our wedding was outstanding. Our favorite food is Mexican food, so we decided to have a Mexican buffet served at the wedding. We STILL have friends/family that tell us that it was the best food they ever had at a wedding! Again, our event coordinator Tabby Bell is top notch. She is very knowledgeable, professional, very energetic and has a great personality so she was a pleasure to meet with.Our hotel booking manager was Claire Roddy was great to work with as well.

She was flexible and understanding during the entire process. Our ceremony took place at the gazebo by the water and The Abbey set up a water station for all guests during the ceremony. The gazebo provided stunning views and amble seating for our 177 guests.The food was simply amazing at our reception. We served prime rib, a pasta dish, and short ribs. I have received so many compliments on the overall taste and quality of the food. The open bar package made sure all of our guests had a great time tearing up the dance floor.

Our wedding took place in the gazebo by the West Shore Pavilion, and the reception was in the pavilion. It was beautiful, quiet, and quaint, just as we'd hoped, and we loved that we were able to go right from our ceremony to cocktail hour to our reception without taking transportation. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and they all thought the resort was one of the nicest places they've stayed, from the rooms to the amenities. I want to give a special thanks for Robyn Moe, our wedding coordinator, who was amazing throughout the whole process of planning our wedding. She answered all of our e-mails and phone calls very promptly, and she made sure that our day was just as we'd imagined it. I can't thank her enough for bearing with us, especially towards the end when I was getting overwhelmed and had to change some things in a matter of days. She even picked me up in a golf cart to drive me from my room to the reception tent right before the ceremony when my husband asked her if she could. Also, Justin Juntunen, who helped us book our room and block of room for our guests, was awesome and was always there to answer e-mails promptly and take care of any situations we needed help with. I also want to thank Tauna, from the Avani Spa in The Abbey resort. She did my hair trial and my hair on they day of the wedding, and she was absolutely incredible at making my hair look just like the picture from Pinterest that I showed her. She was also very friendly, kind, and she made me feel very at ease on the day of the wedding. She is truly talented at what she does, and I wouldn't want anyone else to do my hair on the day of my wedding :).

The entire day my husband and I just kept looking at each other and saying ""this day has been so perfect"" because it was!! We worked with Tabby and from beginning to end she was amazing to work with. She was always very responsive to emails and very organized. She made the entire planning process painless and fun! We worked with Claire to book our room blocks. She was also wonderful to work with, very responsive and professional. The food was outstanding considering the volume of these meals that they make. We had the Sea Bass, the Chicken Fontina and the Vegetable tower. One of our guests told me after the reception that the chicken ""may have been the best thing I have eaten in my entire life"". How cool is that?? I've been to other functions at The Abbey before with different menu options and the food was outstanding then too. Another plus, we had a lot of guests with various nutritional restrictions (gluten free, nut free, dairy free, vegan, celiac's). We had every kind of restriction imaginable it seemed like for some of our guests. Tabby assured us that all of them would be accommodated and none of the restrictions were a problem. Whatever our guests needed, they would make it happen. And they did!There are so many other wonderful things I can say about our day and The Abbey and their staff but there isn't enough room! We can't imagine having our wedding anywhere else. Our guests were blown away by everything the entire weekend. We would recommend The Abbey everyday of the week.

The spa pool was closed for renovations and was told we could use the normal indoor pool (...duh- everyone can use the normal indoor pool...) however, when we went to use the pool they had rented it out to local kids for swimming lessons. There were 25 kids swimming, picking their noses and butts (no really, i'm not kidding or being sarcastic), and jumping around kicking us in the hot tub as well. Not the birthday spa experience I paid 300 for. When customers are unhappy, don't offer to transfer their reservation to another hotel farther away. That doesn't solve the problem- at all. It just seems like you want to send your unhappy customers to someone else to deal with. I loved this place before, but after the last time I will never be going back. Way to disappoint.",Miranda J.

There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch.

I did see they had an indoor pool too. ) I would definitely stay here again on our next trip north.",Kelly

4226,4226,4350,1350 W Atlantic St,"Wedding Sites,Hotels,Hotels & Motels,Meeting Facilities",Emporia,Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Emporia,23847,VA,3.0,We booked the hotel for the pool. My children and I went to the pool ready for a swim and found the pool room very cold (perhaps 55 degrees). We asked thedesk personell and she told us they were closing the pool the next day so that was as good as it got. The water temperature was too cold for a swim. Please know that we are accustomed to swimming in the frigid waters of the gulf of Maine. We went in the hot tub only to have a traffic of employees come through to open the door to the outside (20 degrees) for a smoke break. The smoke and cold came into our area and this ended our pool experience.,A Traveler

My 11 year old daughter said the beds felt like they were peed in. They really need to invest in some dehumidifiers.

Hotels was easily accessible to 95, so that made it a good choice for me and I usually have success with Holiday Inn places. The air conditioning in the hotel didn't work above the main floor - the elevators were a hot box. Only the rooms seemed to have proper air conditioning. Staff was rude when we asked for a tooth brush. A sign clearly marks that complimentary tolietries are available but when we asked (simply forgot my toothbrush at home) the on site manager wanted to argue with me. It took me grabbing the sign and bringing it back down stairs to get her to provide me with a toothbrush.",Charlie Hoever III
